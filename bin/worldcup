    $ worldcup teams | head -5
    Group A                 FIFA Code

=head1 DESCRIPTION
                                                                   
 Retrieve the latest World Cup results for the current matches, the matches of the present day, 
 the results from the group stage, or the matches planned for the next day. By default, scores are not shown 
 except for the 'worldcup matches' and 'worldcup group_results' commands, which should allow one to check on 
 the mathces without finding out the results. For all commands, the results may be written to a file for analysis 
 or plotting.
