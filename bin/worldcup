=head1 NAME

worldcup - Command-line access to World Cup match results

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    ## Get a chronological listing of match results:

    $ worldcup matches

    ## Get the results for each group:

    $ worldcup group_results

    ## Get a listing of all the teams by group. This command displays the 3-letter FIFA code for each country, 
    ## but not any scores (just showing the first group below):

    $ worldcup teams | head -5
    Group A                 FIFA Code
    Brazil                  BRA
    Croatia                 CRO
    Cameroon                CMR
    Mexico                  MEX

=head1 DESCRIPTION
                                                                   
 Retrieve the latest World Cup results for the current matches, the matches of the present day, 
 the results from the group stage, or the matches planned for the next day. By default, scores are not shown 
 except for the 'worldcup matches' and 'worldcup group_results' commands, which should allow one to check on 
 the mathces without finding out the results. For all commands, the results may be written to a file for analysis 
 or plotting.
